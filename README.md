# Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification

## Overview
Multilingual toxic comment classification is an NLP task aimed at detecting harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content across multiple languages. Unlike monolingual classification, this approach must handle linguistic variability, code-switching, transliteration, and cultural differences.

## Features
- Detects toxicity in multiple languages
- Handles code-switching and transliteration
- Uses deep learning models like mBERT and XLM-R
- Supports datasets like Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Dataset
- Evaluates model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score

## Challenges
- Language variability: Different grammar and semantics across languages
- Code-switching: Mixed-language content in comments
- Data scarcity: Limited toxic comment datasets for low-resource languages
- Contextual understanding: Words may have different meanings based on region
- Bias and fairness: Model bias due to data imbalance

## Approach
1. Preprocessing
   - Tokenization and normalization
   - Handling special characters, emojis, and transliteration
   - Data augmentation using back-translation

2. Model selection
   - mBERT and XLM-R for cross-lingual understanding
   - Fine-tuning on multilingual datasets
   - Zero-shot learning for underrepresented languages

3. Training and evaluation
   - Using Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Dataset
   - Training with diverse linguistic inputs
   - Evaluating with precision, recall, and F1-score
   
## Applications
- Social media moderation: Filtering harmful comments on global platforms
- Online communities: Preventing hate speech and cyberbullying
- News and forums: Ensuring respectful discussions across languages

## Future Enhancements
- Expanding dataset coverage for low-resource languages
- Improving bias mitigation techniques
- Enhancing interpretability of model decisions
